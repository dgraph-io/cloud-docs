Slash GraphQL and Dgraph Cloud are compatible with majority of Dgraph features,
and you can easily migrate your existing Dgraph app over to Slash.

To get started

1. Create a new backend. This can be done via the Slash GraphQL interface, or by using the [command line tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slash-graphql)
2. (optional) Switch your backend to [flexible mode](/admin/backend-modes#flexible-mode).
3. Connect to your backend with your favorite client. Please see [Connecting from Dgraph Clients](/advanced-queries#connecting-from-dgraph-clients)

Slash GraphQL and Slash Enterprise are compatible with majority of Dgraph features, and you can easily migrate your existing Dgraph app over to Slash.

Here is how to get started

* Create a new backend. This can be done via the Slash GraphQL interface, or by using the [command line tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slash-graphql)
* Switch your backend to [flexible mode](/admin/backend-modes#flexible-mode).
* Connect to your backend with your favorite client. Please see [Connecting from Dgraph Clients](/advanced-queries#connecting-from-dgraph-clients)

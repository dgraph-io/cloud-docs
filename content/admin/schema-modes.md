Dgraph Cloud supports three different schema modes, which control how the
underlying Dgraph instance is configured. Each mode is pre-configured to provide
simplicity and ease-of-use. 

The schema modes are as follows:

- [Read-Only mode](#read-only-mode): In this mode, no schema changes or mutations are allowed
- [Strict mode](#strict-mode): In this mode, only mutations on predicates that are already present in the schema are allowed
- [Flexible mode](#flexible-mode): In this mode, there are no global restrictions on schemas and mutations;
   this mode also provides access to advanced Dgraph features

By default, your Dgraph Cloud schema will run in [Strict mode](#strict-mode). If
you want to have the same behavior as a local Dgraph instance, change your
schema to [Flexible mode](#flexible-mode). 

## Read-only Mode

In read-only mode, all mutations and attempts to alter the Cloud schema are
blocked. You can still access your data through read-only queries.

## Strict Mode

Strict mode is the default setting on Dgraph Cloud. In this mode, Dgraph Cloud
will enforce a [strict schema](https://dgraph.io/docs/deploy/dgraph-administration/#restricting-mutation-operations),
only allowing mutations on predicates already present in the schema.

You can use GraphQL and DQL (formerly *GraphQL+-*) queries and mutations in this
mode, as described in the [advanced queries](/advanced-queries/) section.
However, all queries and mutations must be valid for the applied schema.

{{% notice "note" %}}
In **Strict mode**, before executing a mutation on a predicate that doesnâ€™t
exist in the schema, you need to perform an `alter` operation with that
predicate and its schema type.

## Flexible Mode

Flexible mode is suitable for users who are already familiar with Dgraph.
Flexible mode removes any restrictions on schemas and mutations, and also
provides access to advanced Dgraph features like:

* Directly altering the schema with the `/alter` HTTP and GRPC endpoints.
* Support for access control lists (ACLs).

## Changing your Schema Mode

To change your schema mode, go to the [settings page](https://cloud.dgraph.io/_/settings),
click the <kbd>Advanced</kbd> tab, and then select a mode from the 
**Schema Mode** list box.

### Changing your Schema Mode with the `/alter` endpoint

{{% notice "tip" %}}
Dgraph Labs recommends using the Dgraph Cloud [settings page](https://cloud.dgraph.io/_/settings)
to alter your schema mode for most scenarios, instead of using the `/alter` endpoint.

You can alter your schema mode directly in the schema using the `/alter` HTTP
and GRPC endpoints. To set your schema mode, configure `UpdateOption` to use one
 of the following values in your schema:

* To use Read Only mode, set `UpdateOption` to `readonly`
* To use Strict mode, set `UpdateOption` to `graphql`
* To use Flexible mode, set `UpdateOption` to `flexible`
